                <div class="cottrai">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero.

           <br><div class="noidung phandoan">In 2000, the first Sushi Shop boutique opened at the Atwater Market in Montreal, when sushi was still considered as an exotic trend. Since then, Sushi Shop has emerged as one of the fastest-growing brands in the nation with over 150 locations across Canada. Innovation is one of the brand’s promises, which consistently delivers new experiences to fans. We have since, expanded far beyond traditional sushi by offering Poke Bowls, Sushi Tacos, Sushi Burrito, Sushi Burgers and other menu items that appeal to a broader audience. Sushi Shop has been passionately committed since our beginning to being unlike any other sushi experience available. Our progressive approach to sushi pays homage to the artisanal beauty of traditional sushi, while also pushing the boundaries by combining sushi with other global cuisines and flavor profiles. Sushi Shop also takes sushi where it’s never been before by offering such genre-bending products as Poke Bowl, Sushi Tacos, Sushi Pizza, Sushi Burritos and Black Sesame Ice Cream. We also appeal to those who may not be in the mood for sushi by offering a fresh twist on Japanese cuisine. For example, our Poke bowls are delicious, nutrient-packed, flavor explosions that use several core sushi ingredients but are styled more like a salad. The diversity of our menu allows us to cater to every type of lifestyle and dietary preference.
